## Data Limitations

This analysis has several constraints to note:

1. **Small sample size:** 14 posts over 10 weeks limits statistical confidence
2. **Outlier impact:** One viral post (Shopify) skews averages significantly
3. **Algorithm changes:** LinkedIn algorithm may have shifted during period
4. **External factors:** Seasonality (late summer/fall) may influence results
5. **Network growth:** Account following size not controlled for
6. **Content variety:** Not all themes tested equally (e.g., only 1 retention post)

**Recommendation:** Continue collecting data for 6-12 months to validate patterns and identify trends.

## Important Note: Strategy Change

**Ghostwriter benchmarks to beat:**
- 3,563 avg impressions
- 29 avg reactions
- 5 avg comments

---

## November 2025 Performance (Authentic Voice Strategy - Month 1)

**Data Period:** November 2-13, 2025 (6 posts)
**Strategy:** Authentic voice with DYODE authority positioning
**Format:** Testing new post length guidelines (200-250 words)

### November Performance Summary

| Date | Post | Impressions | Reactions | Comments | Eng Rate |
|------|------|------------|-----------|----------|----------|
| Nov 13 | Cart abandonment | 603 | 7 | 0 | 1% |
| Nov 11 | Email segmentation | 1,029 | 9 | 1 | 1% |
| Nov 9 | Three brand types | 347 | 3 | 0 | 1% |
| Nov 6 | A/B testing during Q4 | 520 | 8 | 0 | 2% |
| Nov 4 | Site speed/apps | 929 | 13 | 5 | 2% |
| Nov 2 | BFCM season | 609 | 10 | 2 | 2% |
| **Average** | | **673** | **8** | **1** | **1.3%** |

### Key Observations

**Performance vs Baseline:**
- Average impressions: 673 (vs 3,563 ghostwriter baseline) - 81% below
- Average reactions: 8 (vs 29 baseline) - 72% below
- Average comments: 1 (vs 5 baseline) - 80% below
- Average engagement rate: 1.3% (vs 1.8% baseline) - 28% below

**Strengths:**
- Nov 4 (Site speed): 929 impressions, 13 reactions, 5 comments - best tactical content
- Nov 11 (Email segmentation): 1,029 impressions - best reach
- Nov 2, 4, 6 (Thu/Tue posts): 2% engagement rate - aligned with historical Thursday strength

**Weaknesses:**
- Nov 9 (Three brand types): 347 impressions - abstract positioning underperformed
- Nov 13 (Cart abandonment): 603 impressions, 0 comments - good reach, no discussion
- Overall: Below benchmark across all metrics

### Analysis

**Why November underperformed:**

1. **Content mismatch:** Posts leaned toward abstract positioning instead of tactical "how-to" that historically performs well (Shopify migration: 31,477 impressions)
2. **Missing urgency:** November posts didn't capitalize on pre-BFCM timing like Sept 25 Shopify post did
3. **Format adjustment period:** First month testing 200-250 word format; older viral posts were longer

**What worked in November:**
- Tactical content (site speed, email segmentation) matched historical high performers
- Thursday/Tuesday posts had higher engagement rates (2%) vs Sunday (1%)
- Specific metrics and client examples drove engagement

**What didn't work:**
- Abstract positioning posts (brand types) underperformed by 60%
- Posts without clear takeaways (cart abandonment) got reach but no comments
- General observations without specific proof points

### December Strategy Adjustments

Based on November findings and historical analysis:

1. **Lead with tactical metrics** - Nov 4 outperformed because it included specific load time improvements
2. **Include before/after** - When possible, show results (like Shopify's 3-6 month timeline)
3. **Focus on urgency** - December planning window is timely; emphasize "what to do before 2026"
4. **Maintain 200-250 word format** - But ensure every post has a specific takeaway
5. **Increase client examples** - Historical data shows case studies drive engagement
6. **Avoid pure positioning** - "Three types of brands" (347 impressions) vs "Here's what worked in BFCM" (would have driven higher engagement)

### Next Steps

- Continue monitoring November 18, 20 posts (new tactical mobile/retention content)
- Track December performance against updated recommendations
- Reassess baseline in January 2026 after 3 months of authentic voice data
