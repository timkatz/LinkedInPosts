## Data Limitations

This analysis has several constraints to note:

1. **Sample size:** 34 posts over 4+ months provides moderate statistical confidence
2. **Outlier impact:** One viral post (Shopify Sep 25) significantly skews ghostwriter averages
3. **Strategy change:** Oct 30 transition makes direct comparison difficult
4. **Algorithm changes:** LinkedIn algorithm may have shifted during period
5. **External factors:** Seasonality (BFCM, holiday) may influence results
6. **Network growth:** Account following size not controlled for
7. **Content variety:** Migration content heavily represented in top performers

**Recommendation:** Continue tracking through Q1 2026 to validate Tuesday timing shift and migration content focus.

## Important Note: Strategy Change

**Baseline Date: October 30, 2025**

Starting Oct 30, 2025, all posts use the new authentic voice strategy:
- voice-guide.md (Tim's authentic voice)
- humanization-guide.md (eliminate AI tells)
- clients.md (approved brands only)

**Ghostwriter benchmarks (Aug-Oct):**
- 3,563 avg impressions
- 29 avg reactions
- 5 avg comments
- 1.8% avg engagement rate

**Authentic voice performance (Nov-Dec):**
- 1,131 avg impressions (-68% vs ghostwriter)
- 13 avg reactions (-55% vs ghostwriter)
- 2 avg comments (-60% vs ghostwriter)
- 1.8% avg engagement rate (same as ghostwriter)

**Key insight:** Engagement rate is unchanged, suggesting content quality is maintained. The reach/impressions gap is the primary challenge to address.

### Analysis

**Why November underperformed on impressions:**

**What worked in November:**
- Tactical how-to content (site speed, mobile UX, email segmentation) drove highest impressions
- Posts with specific frameworks and numbered steps performed better
- Retention/BFCM focus on Nov 20 drove highest engagement rate (4%) and most comments (9)
- Tuesday posts averaged 1,087 impressions vs Thursday 722 vs Sunday 512

**What didn't work:**

- Short reflection posts without actionable takeaways
- Sunday posts consistently underperformed (512 avg impressions)

**Day of Week Performance (November):**
| Day | Posts | Avg Impressions | Avg Reactions | Avg Comments |
|-----|-------|-----------------|---------------|--------------|
| Tuesday | 3 | 1,087 | 12 | 2 |

   - Format: "X apps → Y apps" or "A% → B% improvement"

   - Checklists, numbered steps, before/after comparisons
   - Save abstract thought pieces for occasional variety

4. **Maintain 250-350 word length**
   - Short posts (under 150 words) consistently underperform
   - Longer tactical posts drive both reach and engagement
