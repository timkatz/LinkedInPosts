# Writing Like a Human (Not AI)

**Created:** October 29, 2025
**Purpose:** Eliminate AI tells and make Tim's posts sound authentically human

---

## The Problem

AI-generated content has specific patterns that immediately signal "a robot wrote this." Even with great strategy and authentic voice, these tells undermine credibility.

**This guide ensures every post sounds like Tim actually wrote it.**

---

## AI Tells to ELIMINATE

### 1. Em-Dashes (—)

**AI loves these. Humans rarely use them in social media.**

❌ AI: "Discovery takes time — sometimes months — depending on complexity."
✅ Human: "Discovery takes time. Sometimes months, depending on complexity."

✅ Alternative: Use periods, commas, or parentheses instead.

### 2. AI Vocabulary Words

These words are AI signatures. Avoid them entirely:

**Never use:**
- Delve / delving
- Unlock / unlocking (as in "unlock growth")
- Harness / harnessing
- Leverage (as a verb, unless in finance context)
- Game-changer / game-changing
- Cutting-edge
- Robust
- Streamline / streamlining
- It's worth noting that...
- Furthermore / Moreover / Additionally
- Landscape (as in "eCommerce landscape")
- Journey (as in "your eCommerce journey")
- Ecosystem
- Holistic
- Paradigm / paradigm shift
- Synergy
- Low-hanging fruit
- Circle back
- Deep dive (as noun)
- Unpack (as in "let's unpack this")

**Use instead:**
- Instead of "unlock growth" → "grow faster" or "increase revenue"
- Instead of "leverage" → "use"
- Instead of "game-changer" → "this changes everything" or just describe the impact
- Instead of "delve into" → "look at" or "examine"
- Instead of "furthermore" → "also" or just start new sentence

### 3. Transition Phrases

**AI uses formal transitions. Humans don't on LinkedIn.**

❌ AI: "Moreover, this approach yields better results. Additionally, it costs less."
✅ Human: "This works better. And it costs less."

**Avoid:**
- Moreover
- Furthermore
- Additionally
- In addition to
- However (start of sentence)
- Nevertheless
- Consequently
- Therefore (unless you're doing math)

**Use instead:**
- And
- But
- So
- Also
- Plus
- Or just start a new sentence

### 4. The Rule of Three

**AI constantly lists three things. Humans vary.**

❌ AI: "This improves conversion, reduces costs, and increases customer satisfaction."
✅ Human: "This improves conversion and cuts costs." (Two items)
✅ Human: "This improves conversion, cuts costs, increases satisfaction, and makes customers happier." (Four items)

**Mix it up:** Sometimes two items, sometimes four, sometimes five. Rarely exactly three.

### 5. Overly Perfect Grammar

**AI uses textbook grammar. Humans don't.**

❌ AI: "One must consider the implications of this decision."
✅ Human: "You need to think about what this means."

❌ AI: "It is important to note that this approach requires careful planning."
✅ Human: "Look, this needs planning."

**Use:**
- Contractions (you're, we're, don't, can't)
- Sentence fragments. Like this.
- Start sentences with And, But, Or
- End with prepositions if natural ("What are you looking at?")

### 6. Hedging Language

**AI hedges everything. Tim is direct.**

❌ AI: "This may potentially improve your results, depending on various factors."
✅ Human: "This improves results. We've seen it work."

❌ AI: "It's worth considering that this approach could be beneficial."
✅ Human: "Try this. It works."

**Avoid:**
- May / might / could (unless genuinely uncertain)
- Potentially / possibly
- It's worth noting / considering
- Various / numerous (be specific)
- Tend to / tends to

### 7. List Introductions

**AI announces lists formally.**

❌ AI: "Here are three key strategies to consider:"
✅ Human: "Try these:"

❌ AI: "The following approaches have proven effective:"
✅ Human: "What works:"

### 8. Emoji Overuse or No Emoji Use

**AI either uses no emojis or uses them weirdly.**

For Tim's LinkedIn:
- Use sparingly (0-1 per post max)
- Only when it genuinely adds meaning
- Never decorative emoji borders
- Common safe ones: 📈 💰 ⚡️ 🎯
- Avoid: 🚀 💡 🔥 (overused in business content)

### 9. Perfect Parallel Structure

**AI loves perfectly parallel lists. Too perfect feels robotic.**

❌ AI (too perfect):
"How to optimize your site:
- Reducing load time
- Improving checkout flow
- Enhancing mobile experience"

✅ Human (natural):
"How to optimize your site:
- Cut load time
- Fix your checkout
- Make mobile work"

### 10. Lack of Personality

**AI is neutral and polite. Humans have opinions and edge.**

❌ AI: "This approach may not be optimal for all situations."
✅ Human: "This doesn't work for small brands. Don't waste your time."

---

## How Humans Actually Write

### 1. Use Sentence Fragments

Full sentences all the time? Feels formal.

✅ "Discovery takes months sometimes. Depending on the project. That's normal."

✅ "Site converting at 0.8%. Not good."

✅ "Here's the thing. Most brands aren't ready yet."

### 2. Vary Sentence Length

**AI tends toward medium-length sentences. Humans mix.**

Short. Medium-length sentence here. And then sometimes a longer sentence that flows naturally and connects multiple thoughts without feeling forced.

✅ Example:
"Client called last week. Site converting at 0.8%. Their previous agency kept saying they needed more traffic. We told them the site was broken. Fixed mobile UX and checkout flow. Same traffic, 3.1% conversion. Revenue jumped 285%."

(Notice: 4 words, 5 words, 11 words, 7 words, 6 words, 5 words, 3 words - varied rhythm)

### 3. Use Contractions

Don't write like a textbook.

❌ "You are spending $50k and you are not seeing results."
✅ "You're spending $50k and you're not seeing results."

✅ More contractions: don't, can't, won't, we're, they're, you've, I've, it's

### 4. Natural Repetition

**Humans repeat for emphasis. AI avoids repetition.**

✅ "This is simple. Really simple. But most brands miss it."

✅ "They wanted more traffic. More traffic. That wasn't the problem."

### 5. Conversational Connectors

**How Tim naturally writes (from voice interview):**

- "Look, ..."
- "Here's the thing ..."
- "The reality is ..."
- "What we're seeing ..."
- "I get it ..."

These feel human because they mirror speech patterns.

### 6. Incomplete Comparisons

**AI completes every comparison. Humans don't always.**

❌ AI: "This approach is better than the alternative approach."
✅ Human: "This works better."

✅ "Faster. Cheaper. Easier to use." (Than what? Context implies it.)

### 7. Direct Address

**Talk TO the reader, not ABOUT them.**

❌ AI: "Brands often struggle with conversion optimization."
✅ Human: "You're probably struggling with conversion."

❌ AI: "One should consider the implications."
✅ Human: "Think about what this means for you."

### 8. Real Numbers, Not Round Numbers

**AI uses clean round numbers. Real data is messier.**

❌ AI: "Conversion improved by 50%"
✅ Human: "Conversion went from 0.8% to 3.1%" (more specific, more real)

❌ AI: "We work with 100+ clients"
✅ Human: "We work with 50+ clients" (real number from clients.md)

### 9. Imperfect Phrasing

**Don't optimize every phrase to perfection.**

✅ "This is one of those things that most brands get wrong."
(AI would say: "This is a common mistake brands make.")

✅ "Look, I get why brands do this. It makes sense on paper."
(AI would say: "While this approach seems logical, it's often ineffective.")

---

## Scenario Reality Check (Critical!)

**AI loves to manufacture LinkedIn-optimized drama. Humans tell real stories.**

### The Problem: Manufactured Scenarios

AI will create scenarios that "sound good" for engagement but don't make logical sense or aren't realistic.

**Example of manufactured drama:**
❌ "Brand sent us their monthly report yesterday. Traffic up 40%. Engagement up 65%. They wanted to celebrate. We looked at revenue. Down 12%."

**Why this fails:**
1. **Timeline doesn't make sense:** "Yesterday" (Saturday) → "3 months later" in same post?
2. **Unrealistic reaction:** No brand celebrates when Q4 sales are down 12% - that's panic mode
3. **Manufactured for engagement:** Sounds LinkedIn-y but didn't actually happen this way

### The Fix: Real Patterns Only

✅ **Use real patterns Tim actually sees:**
- Traffic up but conversions down (this happens)
- But the emotional reaction must be realistic (concern, not celebration)
- And the timeline must make sense (don't mix "yesterday" with "3 months later")

✅ **Example of real scenario:**
"We've worked with three brands this year where traffic was up 30-40% but conversions stayed flat or dropped. In each case, their marketing agency was driving the wrong audience. High bounce rates, low time on site, zero purchases. The traffic looked good in reports, but it wasn't qualified."

**Why this works:**
- Pattern over time (not manufactured drama)
- Realistic reaction (implied concern, not celebration)
- Logical timeline (this year, pattern across multiple brands)
- Actually happened

### Key Questions Before Using Any Scenario:

1. **Did this actually happen?** (Not "could this happen" or "this would be interesting")
2. **Does the timeline make sense?** (No mixing "yesterday" with "3 months later")
3. **Is the emotional reaction realistic?** (Q4 sales down = panic, not celebration)
4. **Would Tim actually tell this story this way?**

**When in doubt, use aggregate patterns instead of specific scenarios:**
- "We've seen 5+ brands this year with..." (safer, still real)
- "At PacSun, we noticed..." (real pattern from past)
- "Across our client base..." (aggregate, real)

---

## LinkedIn-Specific Humanization

### 1. Line Breaks

**Use line breaks for readability, but not in AI patterns.**

❌ AI pattern (every sentence new line):
"This is important.

It helps with readability.

It makes scanning easier.

You should try it."

✅ Human pattern (natural grouping):
"This is important. It helps with readability.

You should try it. Makes scanning easier."

### 2. No Formal Opening/Closing

**This is LinkedIn, not an email.**

❌ AI: "Dear connections, I wanted to share..."
❌ AI: "What are your thoughts on this? I'd love to hear from you in the comments below."

✅ Just start: "Client called yesterday..."
✅ Natural end: "If you've dealt with this, let's talk."

### 3. Vary Post Structure Completely

**AI falls into patterns. Every 5th post shouldn't follow same structure.**

Don't:
- Always start with a question
- Always end with CTA
- Always use bullet lists
- Always write same length

Do:
- Mix it up constantly
- Sometimes no list at all
- Sometimes no question
- Sometimes no CTA

---

## Tim-Specific Humanization

Based on voice interview, Tim's natural patterns:

### 1. Tim's Natural Connectors

✅ "Look, ..."
✅ "Here's the thing ..."
✅ "The reality is ..."
✅ "I get it ..."
✅ "To be honest ..."

Use these occasionally. Not in every post, but when they fit.

### 2. Tim's Natural Sentence Style

From voice interview, Tim said he uses:
- "Style C" conversational approach
- Starts with "Look," when making a point
- Direct statements, not flowery language

✅ Example in Tim's voice:
"Look, discovery can take months. It depends on complexity. Some brands need 2 weeks, some need 12. Both are fine."

### 3. Tim's Number Style

Tim is data-driven and specific:

✅ "Client converting at 0.8%"
✅ "Revenue jumped 285%"
✅ "Cut load time by 2.6 seconds"

Always include context with numbers (not just "conversion improved").

### 4. Tim's Dialogue Style

From voice interview, Tim likes including what people said:

✅ "Agency kept telling them 'you need more traffic.' We told them their traffic is fine, their site is broken."

Include actual dialogue in quotes when telling stories.

---

## Before & After Examples

### Example 1: Case Study

❌ **AI-Written:**
"A leading fashion brand approached us with conversion challenges. Their previous agency recommended increasing traffic acquisition—however, we identified fundamental site issues. By implementing mobile UX improvements and streamlining the checkout process, we achieved a 285% revenue increase. This demonstrates the importance of addressing root causes rather than pursuing additional traffic acquisition."

Issues:
- Em-dash (—)
- "However" at start
- "Streamlining"
- "Leading fashion brand" (vague)
- "demonstrates the importance of" (formal)
- Too polished
- No dialogue
- Passive voice

✅ **Human (Tim's Voice):**
"Client converting at 0.8%. Agency kept saying 'you need more traffic.'

We told them their traffic is fine. The site was broken.

Fixed mobile UX and checkout. Same traffic, 3.1% conversion. Revenue jumped 285%."

Why it works:
- Short sentences
- Includes dialogue
- Specific numbers (0.8%, 3.1%, 285%)
- Direct and simple
- Fragment ("Same traffic, 3.1% conversion")

### Example 2: Agency Differentiation

❌ **AI-Written:**
"Many brands have experienced challenges with agency partnerships—particularly regarding timeline management and deliverable quality. Moreover, discovery phases often extend unnecessarily. Furthermore, communication gaps create friction. It's worth noting that this stems from misaligned expectations. At DYODE, we've developed a framework that addresses these common pain points through transparent processes and measurable outcomes."

Issues:
- Em-dashes
- "Moreover," "Furthermore," "It's worth noting"
- "developed a framework" (too corporate)
- No empathy or personality
- "Misaligned expectations" (corporate speak)
- Way too formal

✅ **Human (Tim's Voice):**
"I get why brands are skeptical of agencies.

George and I have both seen the bad ones. Endless discovery, scope creep, missed deadlines. We've heard the horror stories from friends at other brands.

That's exactly why we built DYODE. We wanted to work the way we saw it done right at PacSun. Clear deliverables, real timelines, measurable results.

If you've been burned before, let's talk."

Why it works:
- "I get why" (empathy)
- Personal names (George, PacSun)
- Real problems listed naturally
- Sounds conversational
- Natural ending invitation

### Example 3: Tactical Advice

❌ **AI-Written:**
"When optimizing your eCommerce site, it's essential to consider multiple factors. Firstly, page load speed significantly impacts bounce rates—studies show that even a one-second delay can reduce conversions. Additionally, mobile optimization is crucial given that mobile traffic continues to grow. Moreover, your checkout flow should be streamlined to minimize friction. By implementing these strategies, you can unlock significant improvements in your conversion rate."

Issues:
- "It's essential to consider"
- Em-dash
- "Firstly, Additionally, Moreover"
- "Unlock" (AI word)
- "Streamlined" (AI word)
- "Given that" (formal)
- No specific examples

✅ **Human (Tim's Voice):**
"Your site is losing money. Here's what to fix first:

Cut your load time. We shaved 2.6 seconds off a client's site. Their bounce rate dropped 8%.

Fix mobile checkout. 60% of your traffic is mobile. If checkout doesn't work on iPhone, you're done.

Remove unnecessary fields. Every extra field in checkout = 10% drop-off.

This is basic stuff. But most brands miss it."

Why it works:
- Direct opening ("Your site is losing money")
- Real example (2.6 seconds, 8%)
- Conversational ("you're done")
- Fragment ("This is basic stuff")
- No AI vocabulary
- Specific tactical advice

### Example 4: Seasonal/Timely Content

❌ **AI-Written:**
"As we approach the holiday season, it's imperative for eCommerce brands to ensure their infrastructure is robust. Migration projects require careful planning—typically spanning 3-6 months. Furthermore, this timeline includes discovery, design, development, QA, and deployment phases. It's worth noting that brands who delay these projects often face challenges during peak season. Therefore, planning should commence immediately to ensure optimal readiness."

Issues:
- "It's imperative" (formal)
- "Robust" (AI word)
- Em-dash
- "Furthermore," "Therefore"
- "It's worth noting"
- "Optimal readiness" (corporate)
- No personality or urgency

✅ **Human (Tim's Voice):**
"It's late September. If you're planning a Shopify migration before holiday season, you're already late.

Here's reality: proper migration takes 3-6 months. Not 3 weeks.

Week 1-4: Discovery
Week 5-12: Design and dev
Week 13-20: QA and data migration
Week 21-24: Launch and monitoring

Brands call us in October wanting to go live by Black Friday. Can't happen. Don't let your agency tell you otherwise.

Start now or wait until January."

Why it works:
- Opens with specific time reference
- "You're already late" (direct)
- Concrete timeline broken down
- Real scenario ("Brands call us in October")
- Strong ending ("Start now or wait")
- No AI words
- Feels urgent and real

## Advanced: The "Read Aloud" Test

**Final test: Read the post out loud.**

If you:
- Stumble over phrases
- Feel like you're giving a presentation
- Sound more formal than you talk
- Notice words you'd never say out loud

...then it's too AI-like. Rewrite it.

Tim's posts should sound like Tim talking to a colleague over coffee. Not like Tim presenting at a conference.

---

## Integration with Voice Guide

This humanization guide works with `voice-guide.md`:

**Voice guide** = Tim's personality, tone, positioning, and what to write about
**Humanization guide** = How to write it so it doesn't sound like AI

Use both together:
1. Check voice-guide.md for what to say and how Tim says it
2. Check humanization-guide.md to eliminate AI tells
3. Run through the checklist
4. Read aloud
5. Post
