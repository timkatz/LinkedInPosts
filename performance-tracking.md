**Baseline Date:** October 30, 2025

---

## Strategy Change Overview

### Before (Aug 17 - Oct 26, 2025): Ghostwriter Posts
- **14 posts analyzed**
- **Style:** Formulaic, italic titles, aggressive tone, made-up scenarios
- **Issues:** Too robotic, overused PacSun, didn't sound like Tim
- **Analysis:** See posts-analysis.md for full breakdown

### After (Oct 30, 2025 onward): Authentic Voice Posts
- **Strategy:** voice-guide.md + humanization-guide.md + content-strategy.md
- **Key changes:**
  - Natural conversational style (no italic titles, varied structure)
  - Real examples from approved clients (clients.md)
  - Contractions and natural rhythm (sounds human, not AI)
  - Empathetic agency differentiation (not aggressive)
  - Balance PacSun with current DYODE work
  - "We/our team" language
  - Eliminated AI tells (no em-dashes, no AI vocabulary)

## Success Criteria

To validate that authentic voice performs better than ghostwriter:

### Minimum Success (3 months of data):
- Average impressions **> 3,563** (beating ghostwriter baseline)
- Average engagement rate **> 1.8%**
- At least **1 viral post** (10k+ impressions) per quarter
- Comments average **> 5** (shows deeper engagement)

### Strong Success:
- Average impressions **> 5,000**
- Average engagement rate **> 2.5%**
- Viral posts (10k+) represent **>15%** of total posts
- Comments average **> 8**

### What We're Testing:
1. **Does authentic voice perform as well or better?**
2. **Do real client examples drive more engagement than anonymous scenarios?**
3. **Does empathetic agency content work better than aggressive call-outs?**
4. **Do posts with contractions and natural rhythm feel more authentic?**
5. **Does balancing PacSun with DYODE current work resonate better?**

- Posting time (both use Thursday 9 AM primarily)
- Seasonal context (ghostwriter was Aug-Oct, new posts are Nov-Dec BFCM)
- Network growth (account follower count may increase over time)
- LinkedIn algorithm changes (platform may shift during comparison period)

**Variables changed:**
- Writing style (formulaic → authentic)
- Tone (aggressive → empathetic/consultative)
- Client references (anonymous/overused PacSun → approved clients + balanced)
- Structure (same every time → varied)
- AI tells (many → eliminated)
