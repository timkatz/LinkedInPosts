# Tim Katz LinkedIn Voice Guide

**Created:** October 29, 2025

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: Also read `humanization-guide.md`**
- This file covers WHAT to say and HOW Tim says it (personality, tone, positioning)
- The humanization guide covers eliminating AI tells (em-dashes, AI vocabulary, etc.)
- Use BOTH together for authentic posts that don't sound like ChatGPT

## Core Voice Principles

### Who Tim Is
- Co-founder of DYODE with George
- Former PacSun eCommerce leader (multi-billion dollar omni-channel retailer)
- Expert with years of experience, but always learning (industry constantly evolves)
- Consultative, patient, plays the long game
- Direct and factual - tells it like it is with data
- Builds relationships over years, not just quick wins

### What DYODE Culture Is
- The Office references and memes internally
- Light sarcasm and personality
- Team-focused ("we/our team" not "I")
- Great relationships with recognizable brands

---

## The Problem with Ghostwritten Content

**What the ghostwriter did wrong:**
- ❌ Too formulaic - every post sounds the same
- ❌ Fake outrage and controversy that doesn't match Tim's approach
- ❌ Too aggressive ("fire your agency") when Tim is actually consultative
- ❌ Rigid structure (italic titles, bullet lists, commands) felt forced
- ❌ Zero personality or humor
- ❌ Overused PacSun references, underused DYODE's current client roster
- ❌ 9/10 authority, 0/10 relatability
- ❌ Made up scenarios Tim hasn't actually experienced

**What actually works (from data):**
- ✅ Specific numbers and percentages
- ✅ Tactical how-to content
- ✅ Case studies with results
- ✅ Agency accountability (when done right)

---

## Tim's Authentic Voice

### Tone & Style

**Direct and Factual**
- No swearing or heavy metaphors
- Speak your mind, tell it as it is
- Lead with data and facts
- Make the problem undeniable with numbers

**Example:**
❌ Ghostwriter: "Most brands obsess over acquisition. Everyone loves getting new customers."
✅ Tim's voice: "You're spending $50k/month on acquisition while 60% of your customers never come back. That's not growth, that's a leaky bucket."

### Story Telling

**Include dialogue and back-and-forth**
- Show what the client said
- Show what you told them
- Show the outcome

**Example:**
✅ "Client's converting at 0.8%. Agency keeps telling them 'you need more traffic.' We told them their traffic is fine, their site is broken. Fixed mobile UX and checkout. 3.1% conversion, 285% revenue jump. Same traffic."

### Agency Accountability (The Right Way)

**The Balance:**
- Agency accountability IS a core differentiator for DYODE
- But express it with empathy, not anger
- Formula: **Acknowledge problem → Personal experience → Why we built DYODE**

**Example:**
✅ "I get why brands are skeptical of agencies. George and I have both seen the bad ones - endless discovery, scope creep, missed deadlines. That's why we built DYODE. We wanted to work the way we saw it done right at PacSun - clear deliverables, real timelines, measurable results."

**Avoid:**
❌ "If your agency can't deliver in 30 days, fire them."
❌ Making up scenarios that didn't happen
❌ Blanket condemnation of all agencies

**Reality:**
- Discovery CAN take months for complex projects
- DYODE works with brands of all sizes and complexity
- Some brands aren't ready yet, and that's okay
- Deals can take a year+ to close - be patient

### Problem-Solving (Consultative vs. Accusatory)

**The Critical Balance:**
- When discussing client problems, be diagnostic not accusatory
- Show you're a partner discovering issues together, not pointing fingers
- Avoid language that blames or makes clients feel foolish
- Use collaborative language that positions DYODE as a guide

**Accusatory Language (❌ Avoid):**
- "Their stack decisions were the problem"
- "The client's mistakes"
- "They failed to..."
- "Your decision caused this"
- Tone: Blame, judgment, superiority

**Consultative Language (✅ Use):**
- "Here's what we found"
- "We discovered"
- "This is a common pattern we see"
- "When we dug in, we saw..."
- Tone: Discovery, guidance, partnership

**Example:**
❌ "Client's site was slow because they made bad stack decisions - too many apps, unoptimized images, their fault."

✅ "We dug in. We found apps adding render-blocking JavaScript, unoptimized images delaying page paint, third-party scripts loading synchronously. Here's what we fixed..."

**Why This Matters:**
- Clients don't need judgment; they need solutions
- Being a real partner means helping them understand WITHOUT making them feel stupid
- Consultative approach builds trust and long-term relationships
- Accusatory approach might get engagement but won't get hired

### Positioning

**Tim is:**
- An experienced guide who's seen it work at scale
- Honest about whether brands are ready
- A resource even when deals aren't imminent
- Always learning (industry constantly evolves)

**Not:**
- An angry disruptor calling everyone out
- A guru with all the answers
- Only focused on closing deals now

**Example:**
✅ "Most brands aren't ready for what they think they need. I'd rather tell you the truth now and be there when you're actually ready than sell you something that won't work."

### Credibility & References

**Use "we/our team" not "I"**
- DYODE is a team, not just Tim
- Occasionally solo "I" is fine, but default to "we"

**PacSun References:**
- Still valuable for credibility
- But don't overuse it
- Balance with DYODE's current work

**DYODE Client References:**
- Only use approved client list (see clients.md)
- Mix approaches:
  - Name brands when appropriate: "We work with brands like AG Jeans and Wyze..."
  - Anonymous: "A premium denim brand we work with..."
  - Aggregate: "Across our 50+ client sites..."
- Get permission before sharing specific results

**Approved Clients:**
- AG Jeans, Wyze, GreenPan, Aloha, Tori Richard, Bandai Namco Shop, Invisalign, Stikwood, L*Space

### Humor & Personality

**Light sarcasm and observations:**
- Let some personality show (not forced)
- Occasional dry wit
- DYODE culture includes The Office and memes, but keep it professional on LinkedIn
- Don't force references - use when they fit

**Examples:**
✅ "Everyone wants to talk about AI. Nobody wants to fix their checkout flow."
✅ "Look, I know this sounds obvious, but..."
✅ "Funny how 'we're in discovery' always means 'we haven't started yet.'"

**Not:**
❌ Constant meme references
❌ Inside jokes only DYODE team would get
❌ Forced humor that doesn't fit

---

## Writing Style

### Natural Writing (Not Formulaic)

**Ghostwriter used rigid structure:**
- *Italic title every time*
- Bullet lists constantly
- Commands at the end
- Same format, same length

**Tim's natural style:**
- Mix it up - some posts short, some longer
- Whatever the content needs
- Natural flow, not templated

### Sentence Structure

**Style C approach:**
- Conversational with "Look," "Here's the thing,"
- Direct statements
- Questions to the reader when appropriate
- Keep it concise (this is social media, not email)

**Example:**
"Look, discovery can take months. It depends on complexity. Some brands need 2 weeks, some need 12. Both are fine."

### Format Elements

**Italic Titles: DROP THEM**
- Felt forced
- Just start naturally

**Bullets vs. Paragraphs:**
- Mix it up based on content
- Use bullets for actual lists/steps
- Use paragraphs for flowing thoughts
- Don't default to bullets just because

**Line Breaks:**
- Use them for readability
- But don't over-format

### Post Length

**Whatever the content needs:**
- Some posts 3-5 sentences
- Some posts 10+ lines
- Vary it - ghostwriter was too consistent

---

## Post Structure

### Openings (Mix It Up)

**Option A - Lead with insight:**
"Look, discovery can take months. It depends on complexity..."

**Option B - Lead with problem:**
"Your checkout is losing you 30% of sales. Here's why..."

**Option C - Lead with observation:**
"We've taken 6 calls this month. Same issue every time..."

**Option D - Lead with question:**
"Why do brands spend $50k on ads but ignore their 0.8% conversion rate?"

**Choose based on what fits the content.**

### Body (Natural Flow)

**Include:**
- Specific numbers and percentages (always)
- Real examples from DYODE's work (when relevant)
- Data and facts to support points
- Clear, actionable takeaways

**Avoid:**
- Generic advice without proof
- Made-up scenarios
- Angry rants
- Formulaic bullets unless they serve the content

### Endings (Mix It Up)

**Option A - Question for engagement:**
"What's your experience been with this?"

**Option B - Invitation to connect:**
"If you've been dealing with this, let's talk."

**Option C - Just end naturally:**
Make your point and stop. No forced CTA.

**Option D - Soft call-out:**
"You don't have to settle for this."

**Option E - DYODE positioning (occasional):**
"This is why George and I built DYODE. If you've been burned before, let's talk about what good partnership looks like."

**Key:** Not every post needs to mention DYODE. Sometimes just give value and let it speak for itself.

## Content Themes

### What to Write About

**✅ Real patterns Tim actually sees:**
- Brands with unrealistic timeline expectations
- Brands burned by previous agencies (now gun-shy)
- Brands who don't know what they actually need
- Brands not ready to invest yet (and that's okay)
- Industry constantly evolving (new tech, new strategies)
- Traffic up but conversions down (junk traffic from agencies)
- DYODE sometimes does just Shopify dev/consulting while another agency handles marketing
- Sometimes DYODE does it all (development + marketing + consulting)

**CRITICAL: Scenarios must be REALISTIC:**
- No brand celebrates "traffic up, sales down" in Q4 - that's panic mode
- Timelines must make sense (don't say "yesterday" then "3 months later" in same post)
- Emotional reactions must match reality (Q4 sales down 12% = concern, not celebration)
- Don't manufacture drama for engagement - use what actually happens

**✅ DYODE's consultative approach:**
- Honest about readiness and timelines
- Patient with long sales cycles
- Resource even when deals aren't imminent
- Problem-solver, not just order-taker

**✅ Agency differentiation (done right):**
- What good agencies do (based on PacSun experience)
- Horror stories from friends at other brands
- Why George and Tim built DYODE differently
- Clear deliverables, real timelines, measurable results

**✅ Tactical, data-driven insights:**
- Specific numbers from DYODE client work
- What's working across their client base
- Industry trends and observations
- Technical how-tos with clear steps

**❌ Avoid:**
- Made-up scenarios for engagement (LinkedIn-optimized drama)
- Fake urgency or outrage
- Blanket condemnations
- Overly aggressive calls to action
- Referencing clients not on approved list
- **Illogical timelines** (e.g., "yesterday" then "3 months later" in same post)
- **Unrealistic emotional reactions** (e.g., brand celebrating when Q4 sales are down)
- **Manufactured drama** that sounds good but isn't true

### Seasonal Content Considerations

**Remember eCommerce reality:**
- Brands are buried during BFCM (Nov 21 - Dec 5)
- Shipping rush in mid-December
- Wind-down late December
- Q1 is golden window (new budgets, planning mode)
- September is perfect for holiday prep urgency

See content-strategy.md for seasonal cadence.

## Voice Comparison Examples

### Example 1: Agency Accountability

**❌ Ghostwriter (too aggressive):**
"Agency calls I've taken this week. I'm hearing the same excuses: 'We're still doing discovery.' Three months later. Stop accepting that progress takes months. If your agency can't show progress in 30 days, find a new one."

**✅ Tim's authentic voice:**
"We've taken 6 calls this month with brands frustrated by their current agencies. Same patterns - unclear timelines, scope creep, endless revisions. Look, I get it. George and I have heard the horror stories from friends at other brands. That's exactly why we built DYODE to work differently. Clear deliverables, measurable results, real communication. If you've been burned before, let's talk."

### Example 2: Tactical Advice

**❌ Ghostwriter (formulaic):**
"Most fashion brands obsess over acquisition. Everyone loves getting new customers. It feels like growth. But acquisition is expensive, and churn destroys profits.

The overlooked lever? Retention. Build a loyalty program. Reward repeat customers.

One brand we work with increased its repeat-purchase rate by 47% by focusing on loyalty."

**✅ Tim's authentic voice:**
"You're spending $50k/month on acquisition while 60% of your customers never come back. That's not growth, that's a leaky bucket.

We worked with a fashion brand converting first-time buyers at 2%. They wanted more traffic. We told them to focus on getting customers to order twice first. Built a simple post-purchase email sequence and VIP early access program.

Repeat purchase rate went from 28% to 47% in 90 days. Same ad spend, way more profit."

### Example 3: PacSun Credibility

**❌ Ghostwriter (overused):**
"After running $100M+ in ecommerce revenue at PacSun, here's what I learned: People don't buy better checkouts or slick animations..."

**✅ Tim's authentic voice:**
"At PacSun, we processed millions of orders. You know what I learned? People don't buy features. They buy outcomes.

They want to look good at their high school reunion. Feel confident at work. Keep up with their friends. Have something that lasts.

Your Shopify store might be perfect technically. But if it doesn't connect to what people actually want, you're just another tab they'll close.

The tech matters. But the psychology matters more."

### Example 4: Real Consultation Scenario

**❌ Ghostwriter (made up urgency):**
"Brand owner last week: 'Can you make our site look more premium?' Wrong question. A pretty site doesn't make money. Focus on the basics first."

**✅ Tim's authentic voice:**
"Had a call yesterday with a brand doing $2M/year. They want a complete redesign to 'look more premium.' Site converts at 2.8%.

We told them honestly - you don't need a redesign yet. You need to fix your mobile checkout (60% of traffic), add trust badges, and improve your product photos. That's $15k, not $100k.

Will they work with us? Maybe not now. But when they're ready for the bigger project, they'll remember we told them the truth."

### Example 5: Industry Evolution

**❌ Ghostwriter (all-knowing expert):**
"Here's exactly how to optimize your site for conversions: [5 steps]"

**✅ Tim's authentic voice:**
"Look, what worked for conversion optimization 2 years ago doesn't always work today. Mobile behavior changes. Checkout expectations evolve. New tools emerge.

Here's what we're seeing work right now across our client base: [specific tactics with data]

But eCommerce is constantly changing. We test everything. Your mileage may vary. This is what's working for us in Q4 2025."
