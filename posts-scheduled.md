### The migration window is open (and closing faster than you think)

**LinkedIn:**

If you want a stable site before Q4 2026, your window to start is January-February. Here's the math.

Shopify migrations for mid-market brands take 3-4 months. Not 3 weeks.

January start means April-May launch. That gives you June through September to optimize your conversion funnel, test your checkout flow, and fix anything that breaks. By October, you're stable. By November, you're ready.

March start means June-July launch. That's barely 3 months before Q4. You'll spend October finding bugs instead of scaling revenue.

May start? You're launching into peak season blind. That's how you end up with checkout issues during BFCM.

Here's our phased approach for brands that need to move fast:

Phase 1 (2-3 months): Launch with a base pre-built theme customized to your brand guidelines. You immediately get Shopify benefits: faster site speed, better conversion rates, Shop Pay button, easier content management.

Phase 2 (immediately following): Move into CRO optimization. Test, improve, refine. Even the base theme performs better than most legacy platforms.

We migrated a $15M fashion brand last year. Started in February, launched in May, optimized through summer. By Q4 they had a stable platform with a tested checkout flow. BFCM went smoothly.

Another brand called us in August wanting an October launch. We told them that timeline creates bugs, missed features, and stressed teams. They waited until January and launched successfully in April.

Migration isn't just moving data from one platform to another. It's an opportunity to fix your conversion funnel, speed up your site, and simplify your tech stack.

When's the last time you stress-tested your platform?

**X/Twitter (280 char):**

If you want a stable site before Q4 2026, start your Shopify migration in January-February. Jan start = Apr-May launch, summer to optimize, stable by Q4. May start = launching into peak season blind. That's how checkout breaks during BFCM. The window is now.

### 2026 starts now: what Q4 revealed about your site

**LinkedIn:**

Your Q4 data just told you everything you need to know about 2026. Most brands won't listen.

We saw three patterns across our client base during BFCM:

**Pattern 1: Platform issues exposed under load.**

A brand we talked to after BFCM lost 3 hours of checkout during peak traffic. Their platform couldn't handle the load. Tens of thousands in revenue, gone.

Our Shopify clients with clean tech stacks? Zero downtime.

If your platform held you back in Q4, that's not going to improve in Q4 2026. Fix it now.

**Pattern 2: Mobile gaps are massive.**

60% mobile traffic, 38% mobile revenue. We saw this pattern repeatedly.

That gap is broken mobile UX, not traffic mix. Brands that fixed mobile in 2025 got conversion rates within 80% of desktop. Brands that ignored it left 20-30% of potential revenue on the table.

If your mobile conversion is half of desktop, that's your biggest opportunity.

**Pattern 3: Conversion leaks upstream from checkout.**

Most brands obsess over cart abandonment. But if 80% of users never made it to cart, that's a product page problem, not a checkout problem.

We worked with a client converting at 0.8%. They wanted more traffic. We told them the site was broken. Fixed mobile UX and simplified the path to conversion. Same traffic, 3.1% conversion. Revenue jumped 285%.

Your Q4 data revealed your constraints. Platform stability. Mobile UX. Conversion funnel leaks.

The brands that act on this in January will outperform the brands that ignore it until summer.

What did your Q4 data reveal?

**X/Twitter (280 char):**

Your Q4 data just told you everything about 2026. Platform issues (3 hours of lost checkout). Mobile gaps (60% traffic, 38% revenue). Conversion leaks (80% never reach cart). The brands that act in January will outperform the brands that ignore it until summer.

### What your Q4 data actually tells you

**LinkedIn:**

Brands with 60% mobile traffic but only 38% mobile revenue have a broken mobile experience. That's not a traffic problem. That's a conversion problem.

Here's how to dig into your Q4 data beyond surface metrics:

**Traffic quality analysis.**

Did your bounce rate spike during BFCM? High traffic with low engagement means you paid for junk traffic. If people bounced in 8 seconds, that's worthless.

Pull your traffic sources. We've seen brands spending big on Meta (high volume, low conversion) while Google Shopping converts 2x better on smaller volume. Reallocate budget to high-intent channels.

**Conversion funnel drop-off points.**

Map where users actually left. Homepage to collection page? Collection to product page? Product page to cart?

Most brands obsess over cart abandonment (10-15% drop-off) when 80% of users never even reached cart. That's a navigation problem or a product page problem, not a checkout problem.

**Device gaps.**

Pull your mobile vs desktop data. If mobile is 60% of traffic but 35% of revenue, test your own site on a phone right now. Is add-to-cart obvious? Does checkout flow smoothly? Every friction point costs you money.

One client had mobile conversion at 0.9% vs desktop at 2.4%. We fixed mobile UX. Mobile jumped to 2.1%. That gap closure added 40% to their revenue.

**Channel profitability.**

Which channels drove actual buyers? We see this constantly: brands celebrate traffic wins without checking conversion by channel.

Email and SMS to existing customers convert 4-6x better than paid acquisition. If you're spending $50k/month on acquisition while 60% of customers never come back, that's backwards.

Your Q4 data revealed what's working and what's broken. Most brands file it away and repeat the same mistakes in 2026.

The brands that dig in now make smarter budget decisions in Q1.

What was your biggest Q4 surprise?

**X/Twitter (280 char):**

60% mobile traffic, 38% mobile revenue = broken mobile UX. Most brands obsess over cart abandonment when 80% of users never reach cart. That's a product page problem. Your Q4 data revealed your constraints. Dig in now or repeat the same mistakes in 2026.

### Q4 winners vs Q4 strugglers: the pattern

**LinkedIn:**

Client A converted at 2.8% during BFCM. Client B converted at 0.9%. Same weekend. Same traffic surge. Completely different outcomes.

Here's what separated them:

**Platform stability.**

Client A migrated to Shopify in Q2. By Q4, their site was stable and tested. Zero downtime during BFCM.

Client B stayed on their legacy platform. Lost 2 hours of checkout during peak traffic because the platform couldn't handle the load. Thousands in revenue, gone.

**Site speed.**

Client A's site loaded in 1.9 seconds. Client B's loaded in 4.2 seconds.

Every second of load time costs you 7-8% conversion. That difference alone explains a massive revenue gap. Client A's bounce rate was 23% lower.

**Tested conversion funnels.**

Client A spent September and October testing product pages and checkout flow. They knew what converted before November hit. They just scaled what worked.

Client B wanted to redesign their entire site in October. We told them no. Stable sites win Q4. They didn't redesign, but they also didn't test. They just hoped their funnel would work under load.

**Mobile UX.**

Client A's mobile conversion was within 85% of desktop. Client B's mobile conversion was half of desktop.

60% of Client B's BFCM traffic came from mobile. But only 35% of revenue. That gap is broken UX, not traffic mix.

The pattern is clear: BFCM rewards preparation and platform stability. Brands that optimized their conversion funnel and site performance won. Brands that just bought more traffic learned expensive lessons.

**X/Twitter (280 char):**

Client A: 2.8% conversion, stable Shopify site, 1.9s load time, tested funnel. Client B: 0.9% conversion, legacy platform with downtime, 4.2s load time, untested funnel. Same BFCM weekend. BFCM rewards preparation and platform stability, not last-minute traffic buys.

### Your Q1 CRO audit checklist

**LinkedIn:**

Before you increase ad spend, run this audit.

A 0.5% conversion lift is worth more than a 50% traffic increase. But most brands budget for ads first, optimization second. Here's what to audit in Q1:

**1. Funnel drop-off analysis.**

Map where users actually leave. Use Google Analytics or Shopify Analytics. Track the path from homepage to checkout.

Find your biggest leak. Is it navigation between homepage and collection page? Collection to product page? Product page to cart?

Most brands obsess over cart abandonment when 80% of users never reach cart. Fix the biggest leak first.

**2. Site speed check.**

If load time is over 3 seconds, you're losing 20-25% of potential conversions before users even see your products.

Delete unused Shopify apps. Compress images. Audit third-party scripts loading on every page. Get under 2.5 seconds.

We cut a client's load time from 4.1 seconds to 1.8 seconds by removing 9 unused apps and optimizing images. Their bounce rate dropped 23%. Conversion jumped 18%.

**3. Mobile UX review.**

Pull your Q4 data. If mobile is 60% of traffic but 35% of revenue, that's your biggest opportunity.

Test your own site on a phone. Is add-to-cart obvious? Does checkout flow smoothly? Can you complete a purchase in under 60 seconds?

Every friction point on mobile costs you money. One client had a mobile conversion gap (0.9% mobile vs 2.4% desktop). We fixed mobile UX. Mobile jumped to 2.1%. Revenue up 40%.

**4. A/B test priorities.**

What are you testing in Q1? Product page layouts? Checkout flow? Mobile navigation?

Don't test everything at once. Test your biggest constraint first. Run tests 2-3 weeks each to get statistically significant data.

We've seen headline changes alone lift conversion 12-15%. Image placement tests add another 8-10%. Small changes compound.

**5. Channel profitability analysis.**

Which channels drove actual buyers in Q4? Email and SMS convert 4-6x better than paid acquisition.

If you're spending $50k/month on ads while 60% of customers never come back, shift budget to retention and lifecycle marketing.

Fix your funnel before you scale traffic. That's how you grow profit, not just revenue.

What's your biggest funnel leak?

**X/Twitter (280 char):**

Before you increase ad spend, audit your conversion funnel. A 0.5% lift beats 50% more traffic. Check: funnel drop-off (80% never reach cart?), site speed (over 3s = losing 20-25%), mobile UX (60% traffic, 35% revenue?), A/B test priorities. Fix funnel before scaling traffic.

### Site speed: the math that matters

**LinkedIn:**

Every second of load time costs you 7-8% conversion. Here's the math that actually matters.

Most brands have 18-22 Shopify apps installed. They use maybe 8. The rest just slow down their site.

Here's how app bloat kills conversion:

Each unused app adds render-blocking JavaScript. That's roughly 0.2 seconds per app. 18 apps means 3.6 seconds of load time before your page even paints.

If your site loads in 4+ seconds, you're losing 25-30% of potential conversions before users see your products. They bounce.

We audited a client's Shopify stack in December. They had 22 apps. 9 were unused (installed for a past campaign, forgotten). 4 were redundant (three different review apps).

We deleted the unused apps. Consolidated the redundant ones. Load time dropped from 4.3 seconds to 1.9 seconds.

Bounce rate dropped 21%. Conversion rate jumped from 1.4% to 2.1%. That's a 50% lift in conversion just from cleaning up their tech stack.

Here's what to delete:

Apps you installed for one campaign and forgot about. Old A/B testing tools you don't use anymore. Redundant apps (you don't need three review apps or two email capture tools). Apps with overlapping functionality.

Here's what to audit quarterly:

Third-party scripts loading on every page. Image compression (uncompressed images kill mobile load time). Shopify theme bloat (some themes load 400+ lines of CSS you don't use).

Expected lift from site speed optimization: 15-25% conversion improvement for sites currently over 3.5 seconds.

We've seen this consistently. Fast sites convert. Slow sites lose users before they engage.

Audit your Shopify stack this month. Delete what you don't use. Your conversion rate will thank you.

**X/Twitter (280 char):**

Every second of load time costs you 7-8% conversion. Most brands have 18-22 Shopify apps, use 8. The rest add 3.6s of load time. We deleted 9 unused apps for a client. Load time: 4.3s → 1.9s. Conversion: 1.4% → 2.1%. That's a 50% lift. Audit your stack quarterly.

### What I learned from 30+ brand calls in December

**LinkedIn:**

December was our busiest month for inbound calls. Brands coming off BFCM, catching their breath, asking about 2026 projects.

Here's what we heard (and what it tells me about where eCommerce is headed):

**"Our platform couldn't handle the traffic."**

Heard this at least 8 times. Checkout breaking during peak hours. Inventory sync failing. Site slowing down when it mattered most. These aren't edge cases. These are brands on legacy platforms that can't scale.

If your Q4 exposed platform limitations, you have 3-4 months to migrate before summer. Wait until June and you're rushing into Q4 stressed.

**"We spent 6 months on a migration that should have taken 3."**

Scope creep is real. Brands told us they started with a simple replatform. Six months later they're still in "discovery" or waiting on custom features that don't move the needle.

Our phased approach works better. Launch with a clean base theme in 2-3 months (immediate benefits: site speed, Shop Pay, better conversion rates). Then move into CRO optimization. You're live faster, testing faster, learning faster.

**"Our conversion rate didn't budge, even with more traffic."**

Traffic up 40%, conversions flat. This was the most common frustration. Marketing agencies are good at driving volume. But if your site converts at 1.2%, more traffic just means more waste.

Brands are realizing they need to fix their funnel before they scale volume. That's where we come in.

**"We don't know what we actually need."**

Honest question, and we respect it. Some brands think they need a full rebuild when they really need mobile UX fixes. Others think they just need a few tweaks when their platform is fundamentally holding them back.

We'd rather tell you the truth now than sell you something that won't work. That's the conversation worth having.

**What I'm taking from this:**

Brands are getting smarter about evaluating agencies. They're asking better questions. They want clear deliverables, realistic timelines, honest assessments. They've been burned by black box relationships and endless discovery phases.

That's exactly why we built DYODE the way we did.

**X/Twitter (280 char):**

30+ brand calls in December. Most common frustration: "Traffic up 40%, conversions flat." Marketing agencies drive volume. But if your site converts at 1.2%, more traffic just means more waste. Fix your funnel before you scale volume. That's where the real ROI lives.

### Questions to ask before hiring an agency in 2026

**LinkedIn:**

Brands that get burned by agencies usually skipped these questions upfront. They assumed "good portfolio" meant good partnership. It doesn't.

Here's what to ask before you sign:

**1. What's the realistic timeline, broken down by phase?**

Not "3-4 months." Ask for specifics. Week 1-4: discovery. Week 5-12: design and dev. Week 13-16: QA and migration. If they can't break it down, they haven't scoped it properly.

Red flag: "We'll know more after discovery." Discovery should clarify execution, not replace it.

**2. What's included in the scope, and what costs extra?**

Agencies love the phrase "additional scope." Find out now what triggers it. Is mobile optimization included? A/B testing? Post-launch support? Get it in writing.

Red flag: "We'll figure it out as we go." That's scope creep waiting to happen.

**3. How often do we communicate, and who's my point of contact?**

Weekly check-ins? Biweekly? Monthly? Who responds to questions? Is there a dedicated project manager, or do you email a general inbox and hope someone answers?

Red flag: No clear communication cadence or single point of contact.

**4. What does success look like, and how do we measure it?**

Is success "site goes live"? Or is it "conversion rate improves by X%"? If the agency can't define measurable outcomes, they're not accountable to results.

Red flag: Vague goals like "improve user experience" without metrics.

**5. What happens if we're not happy with the work?**

Revision process? Refund policy? How do disputes get resolved? These conversations are uncomfortable, but they matter. Agencies that avoid this question usually have bad answers.

Red flag: "That's never happened" or defensive responses.

**6. Can I talk to 2-3 clients who've worked with you in the past year?**

Not just case studies on their site. Real conversations with real clients. Ask those clients: Did the project stay on timeline? On budget? Would you work with them again?

Red flag: "Our clients are under NDA." Some are, but not all of them.

**Look, I get why brands are skeptical.**

George and I have heard the horror stories. Endless discovery. Missed deadlines. Agencies that overpromise and underdeliver. That's exactly why we built DYODE differently. Clear deliverables, real timelines, honest conversations.

If you've been burned before, these questions help you spot the red flags early. If an agency can't answer them clearly, that tells you everything.

**X/Twitter (280 char):**

Before hiring an agency, ask: What's the realistic timeline by phase? What's included vs extra cost? How often do we communicate? What does success look like? Can I talk to recent clients? If they can't answer clearly, that's your red flag. Ask now, not 6 months in.

### The real cost of a bad migration

**LinkedIn:**

A brand reached out to us after BFCM. They'd spent 8 months on a Shopify migration that should've taken 4. Here's what went wrong (and how to avoid it):

**They didn't define scope upfront.**

Project started as a "simple replatform." Three months in, the agency suggested custom checkout features, a new design system, headless architecture. Scope kept expanding. Timeline kept slipping.

By month 6, they'd spent $80k more than quoted and still weren't live.

**Lesson:** Lock scope before you start. Custom features sound great, but every addition adds weeks. If you want to launch fast, use a proven base theme and optimize after you're live. Phased approach beats perfection paralysis.

**They chose an agency without Shopify migration experience.**

Agency had a great portfolio. Beautiful websites. But they'd never migrated a brand to Shopify. They underestimated data migration complexity, didn't know Shopify's limitations, rebuilt features that Shopify already handles natively.

By month 4, they brought in Shopify experts to fix what the first agency got wrong. Started over.

**Lesson:** Shopify migrations aren't generic web projects. Work with an agency that's done 20+ migrations. They know what breaks, what works, and how to avoid expensive mistakes.

**They launched in October.**

After 8 months of delays, they finally went live October 15. Two weeks before peak season. Zero settling period. Bugs surfaced during BFCM. Checkout issues during their highest traffic weekend of the year.

Lost revenue? Tens of thousands. Customer trust? Harder to measure, but it took a hit.

**Lesson:** If you're targeting Q4, you need to launch by September at the latest. Ideally June or July, so you have 3-4 months to test, optimize, and stabilize before peak traffic hits.

**The real cost wasn't the extra $80k.**

It was 4 months of lost optimization time. It was a stressed team scrambling during their biggest revenue period. It was the opportunity cost of what they could've been doing instead of fighting a broken migration.

**Here's how we approach it at DYODE:**

Phase 1: Launch with a clean, proven base theme (2-3 months). You get immediate benefits: faster site speed, better mobile UX, Shop Pay button, easier content management.

Phase 2: Optimize and refine post-launch. A/B test, improve conversion rates, add features that actually move the needle.

You're live faster. Testing faster. Learning faster. And you're not scrambling into Q4 with an untested site.

**If you're planning a 2026 migration, here are the conversations to have now:**

What's the realistic timeline, broken into phases? What's the scope, and what happens when scope expands? What's your agency's Shopify migration track record? When do you need to be live, and are you giving yourself enough settling time?

These questions save you months and thousands of dollars. Ask them before you start, not 6 months in.

**X/Twitter (280 char):**

A brand spent 8 months on a migration that should've taken 4. Launched in October, two weeks before BFCM. Bugs hit during peak traffic. Real cost wasn't the extra $80k. It was lost optimization time and a stressed Q4. If you're planning 2026 migration, start these conversations now.

### 2026 predictions: what's actually changing

**LinkedIn:**

Forget the hype. Here's what's actually shifting in eCommerce this year, based on what we're seeing across our client base:

**CRO is becoming a continuous practice, not a one-time project.**

Used to be brands would run a CRO audit once a year, implement changes, and call it done. Now the smart ones are testing continuously. Quarterly funnel audits. Monthly A/B tests. Ongoing optimization.

Why the shift? CPMs are up 30-40%. Traffic is more expensive. You can't afford to waste it on a broken funnel. Brands are realizing a 0.5% conversion lift is worth more than 50% more traffic.

We're seeing this play out in client conversations. Brands aren't asking "Can you optimize our site?" They're asking "What's your ongoing CRO process?"

**Mobile UX is finally closing the gap.**

For years, brands have lived with 60% mobile traffic and 38% mobile revenue. That gap was just accepted as normal.

Not anymore. Brands that fixed mobile UX in 2025 saw conversion rates within 80% of desktop. The ones that didn't got left behind. 2026 is the year that gap closes for good, or you lose.

Mobile isn't the future. It's been the present for 5 years. Brands are finally treating it that way.

**Site speed is becoming a competitive advantage.**

Everyone talks about site speed. Few brands actually fix it. The ones that do are seeing 15-25% conversion lifts just from dropping load time under 2.5 seconds.

App bloat, uncompressed images, third-party scripts. These are the usual culprits. Quarterly Shopify stack audits are becoming standard. Delete what you don't use. Compress what slows you down. Get fast and stay fast.

In 2026, slow sites don't just underperform. They lose entirely.

**Platform migrations aren't slowing down.**

Q4 2025 exposed platform limitations for a lot of brands. Checkout breaking. Inventory failing. Sites that couldn't handle traffic. We're seeing more migration conversations in January 2026 than any previous year.

Brands on legacy platforms are realizing they can't compete. Shopify's infrastructure, speed, and ecosystem are just better. The migration wave isn't over. It's accelerating.

**Agencies are being held accountable.**

No more 90-day discovery phases with nothing to show. No more vague deliverables and endless revisions. Brands want clear timelines, measurable outcomes, honest communication.

The black box agency model is dying. Transparency wins.

**What we're NOT predicting:**

Buzzwords without substance. "AI will replace eCommerce managers" or "Everyone's going headless." These sound good on a trends report. They don't match what we're seeing in real client data.

The brands winning in 2026 are the ones fixing fundamentals. Fast sites. Tested funnels. Mobile UX that actually works. Clear agency partnerships.

That's not sexy. But it's real.

**X/Twitter (280 char):**

2026 predictions based on real client data: CRO becomes continuous (not one-time project), mobile UX finally closes the gap, site speed becomes competitive advantage, platform migrations accelerate, agencies held accountable. No hype. Just what's actually shifting.

### The product page elements that actually convert

**LinkedIn:**

After reviewing hundreds of product pages across eCommerce brands (including my years at PacSun), here are the 5 elements that actually move conversion rates:

**1. Above-the-fold clarity (within 3 seconds)**

Product name, price, primary image, add-to-cart button. All visible without scrolling. Sounds obvious, but we see brands burying the CTA below lifestyle images or long descriptions.

Test: Can a user add to cart within 5 seconds of landing on the page? If not, you're losing impatient buyers. And most buyers are impatient.

Expected lift from fixing this: 8-12% conversion improvement.

**2. Trust signals near the add-to-cart button**

Free shipping threshold. Return policy. "Ships in 24 hours." These aren't nice-to-haves. They're conversion drivers.

At PacSun, we tested placement. Trust signals right next to the add-to-cart button converted 15% better than the same info buried in the footer.

People need reassurance at the moment of decision. Give it to them exactly when they're deciding.

**3. High-quality images with zoom functionality**

Grainy product photos kill conversion. So do images that don't zoom. Customers want to see fabric texture, stitching details, how the product actually looks.

Minimum: 3-5 images per product. Lifestyle shots AND detail shots. Zoom that doesn't pixelate.

We've seen 10-15% conversion lifts just from upgrading product photography and enabling quality zoom.

**4. Clear size and fit information (for apparel)**

"Model is 5'10" and wearing size M." Actual measurements in inches. Size chart that's easy to find.

Returns are expensive. Sizing confusion drives returns. Give customers the info they need to buy confidently the first time.

At PacSun, we found that clear size info reduced returns by 12% and increased conversion by 8%. People bought more when they felt confident about fit.

**5. Social proof (but make it real)**

Fake reviews destroy trust. Real reviews (even critical ones) build it. If you have 500 5-star reviews and zero critical feedback, customers assume they're fake.

Show recent reviews. Include photos from customers. Respond to negative reviews professionally.

Test what converts better: star rating near product name vs full reviews below description. We've seen both work depending on the brand and product type.

**What doesn't matter as much as you think:**

Long product descriptions. Most people don't read them. Fancy animations. They slow down load time. Tons of cross-sell recommendations. They distract from the primary CTA.

**What to test first:**

Above-the-fold layout. Trust signal placement. Image quality and zoom. Size/fit clarity (if apparel). Review integration.

Run A/B tests for 2-3 weeks each. Measure conversion rate, not just engagement. A beautiful product page that doesn't convert is just expensive design.

Product pages are where revenue happens. Optimize them before you spend another dollar on traffic.

**X/Twitter (280 char):**

After reviewing hundreds of product pages: 5 elements that convert are above-the-fold clarity (within 3 seconds), trust signals near add-to-cart, high-quality zoom images, clear size/fit info, real social proof. Test these before you spend another dollar on traffic. Revenue lives here.

### Mobile UX: closing the revenue gap

**LinkedIn:**

60% mobile traffic, 38% mobile revenue. That gap is costing you 20-30% of potential revenue. Here's how to close it.

**The problem isn't traffic mix. It's broken mobile UX.**

Brands assume mobile users are "just browsing" and desktop users are "serious buyers." Wrong. Mobile users want to buy. Your site just makes it too hard.

We worked with a client last year. 62% mobile traffic, 35% mobile revenue. Fixed their mobile UX. Mobile revenue jumped to 52% of total. Same traffic. Better experience.

Here's what we fixed:

**1. Thumb-friendly navigation**

Mobile users navigate with their thumbs. But most sites put primary navigation at the top of the screen (hard to reach) and CTAs in awkward spots.

Fix: Move critical buttons (add-to-cart, checkout) to the bottom third of the screen. Use sticky navigation that stays accessible. Make tap targets at least 44x44 pixels (Apple's minimum guideline).

Test your own site on a phone. Can you add to cart and checkout using only your thumb? If you're stretching or using two hands, so are your customers. And they'll bounce instead.

**2. Simplify mobile checkout**

Every extra field in mobile checkout = 10% drop-off. Seriously.

We audited a client's mobile checkout. Seven form fields. Cut it to four (name, email, phone, address autofill). Mobile conversion jumped 18%.

Also: Enable Shop Pay, Apple Pay, Google Pay. One-tap checkout beats typing on a tiny keyboard every time.

**3. Fast mobile load times (under 2 seconds)**

Desktop might tolerate 3-4 second load times. Mobile won't. Mobile users are impatient. They're often on slower connections. If your mobile site takes 4 seconds to load, you've lost them.

Compress images specifically for mobile (use responsive images, not desktop-sized files). Delete apps that add mobile render-blocking scripts. Test load time on an actual phone, not just desktop Chrome dev tools.

Target: Under 1.5 seconds on 5G.

**4. Readable product info (without zooming)**

If users have to pinch-zoom to read product descriptions or pricing, you're adding friction. Font size minimum: 16px for body text. 20px+ for product names and pricing.

Also: Break up text with line breaks. Long paragraphs don't work on small screens. Two-sentence paragraphs max.

**5. Test the full mobile journey (don't assume it works)**

Most brands test desktop thoroughly. They assume mobile "just works." It doesn't.

Walk through your entire mobile site like a customer. Homepage to collection to product page to cart to checkout. On an actual phone. Not on desktop in responsive mode. An actual iPhone or Android device.

Where do you get frustrated? Where do you have to zoom? Where do buttons overlap or text cut off? Fix those friction points.

**The mobile revenue gap isn't inevitable.**

Brands that prioritize mobile UX see conversion rates within 80% of desktop (sometimes better). Brands that ignore it leave 20-30% of revenue on the table.

Pull your Q4 mobile data. What's your gap? If mobile is 60% of traffic but only 35% of revenue, that's your biggest 2026 opportunity.

60% mobile traffic, 38% mobile revenue. That gap is costing you 20-30% of potential revenue. Fix: thumb-friendly navigation, simplified checkout (cut form fields), fast load times (under 2 seconds), readable text (no zooming). Pull your Q4 data. What's your mobile gap?

### The first 90 days after a Shopify migration: what to actually focus on

**LinkedIn:**

You just launched your new Shopify site. Now what?

Most brands treat launch day as the finish line. It's not. It's the starting line for 90 days of optimization that determines whether your migration actually delivers ROI.

Here's what to focus on:

**Days 1-30: Stabilization and bug fixes**

Your site is live, but it's not stable yet. This is when hidden issues surface.

Monitor checkout completion rates daily. If they're lower than pre-migration, something's broken. Check form validation, payment gateway integration, mobile checkout flow.

Watch for 404 errors. Pull your analytics. If users are hitting broken links from Google or old email campaigns, set up redirects immediately. Every 404 is a lost sale.

Test your site across devices. Desktop, mobile, tablet. Chrome, Safari, Firefox. Don't assume it works everywhere just because it works on your laptop.

We had a client launch in April last year. Week 2, their mobile checkout broke on Safari (20% of their traffic). Took 3 days to catch it. Cost them roughly $8k in lost revenue. Now we test across browsers before launch, not after.

Fix bugs fast. Don't let them compound.

**Days 31-60: Baseline measurement and quick wins**

By week 5, your site is stable. Now you can measure real performance.

Compare pre-migration vs post-migration metrics. Conversion rate, average order value, bounce rate, site speed, mobile vs desktop gap.

If your conversion rate dropped post-migration, you have a UX problem. If it stayed flat, you have optimization opportunities. If it improved, double down on what's working.

Quick wins to prioritize in this phase:

Site speed optimization. Delete unused apps you migrated over. Compress images. Your target: under 2.5 seconds load time.

Mobile UX refinement. Pull your mobile conversion data. If it's lagging desktop by more than 20%, fix mobile navigation and checkout flow.

Trust signals. Add "Ships in 24 hours" or free shipping thresholds near add-to-cart. At PacSun, we saw 10-15% conversion lifts just from better trust signal placement.

These aren't major rebuilds. They're tactical fixes that move the needle fast.

**Days 61-90: Systematic CRO testing**

By month 3, you know your baseline. Now you can test intelligently.

Run A/B tests on your biggest constraints. If product pages have high bounce rates, test headlines, image placement, CTA copy. If cart abandonment is high, test checkout flow simplification.

Test one variable at a time. Run each test 2-3 weeks to get statistically significant data. Don't test everything at once.

We worked with a client who migrated in Q2 last year. Days 1-30 they stabilized. Days 31-60 they optimized site speed and mobile UX. Days 61-90 they ran 4 A/B tests on product pages and checkout.

By day 90, their conversion rate was 22% higher than pre-migration. Not because of the migration itself. Because they treated the first 90 days as an optimization sprint, not a victory lap.

**What most brands get wrong:**

They launch and move on. They don't monitor. They don't test. They assume the new platform will magically improve results.

Shopify gives you better infrastructure, faster load times, easier management. But it doesn't optimize your funnel for you. That's your job.

The brands that win post-migration treat the first 90 days like a focused CRO project. Stabilize, measure, test, optimize.

What's your post-launch plan?

**X/Twitter (280 char):**

First 90 days post-Shopify migration: Days 1-30 stabilize and fix bugs (monitor checkout, 404s, cross-browser issues). Days 31-60 measure baseline and quick wins (site speed, mobile UX, trust signals). Days 61-90 systematic A/B testing. Launch isn't the finish line. It's the starting line.
