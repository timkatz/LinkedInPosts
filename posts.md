| **Oct 30 2025** | Thu | 9:02 AM  | Working with brands we love                                                                        | Best part about building DYODE? Working with brands we actually love.  <br><br> We wear AG Jeans. We have Wyze cameras in our homes. We eat Aloha bars. These were our brands before they were our clients.  <br><br> That matters. When you're already a customer, you care differently. You know what works and what doesn't. You've been through their checkout. You've gotten their emails.  <br><br> One client hired us partly because our team was already fans. We'd been buying their product for years. They could tell the difference in how we talked about the brand.  <br><br> That's what makes this work. We're not just running campaigns. We're helping brands we genuinely care about win.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |           |          |             |        |          |

| **Oct 26 2025** | Sun | 2:45 PM  | Agency calls I've taken this week                                                                  | *Agency calls I've taken this week*  <br><br> I'm hearing the same excuses from agencies:  <br> - "We're still doing discovery." (Three months later.)  <br> - "We need Q4 planning before we can act." (You signed months ago.)  <br> - "We're waiting on creative from you." (Translation: we have nothing ready.)  <br><br> Stop accepting that progress takes months. Here's what a new partner should do in 30 days:  <br> 1. Week 1: Build the 30‑day plan with clear goals.  <br> 2. Week 2: Write copy and develop creative.  <br> 3. Week 3: Launch campaigns and iterate.  <br> 4. Week 4: Measure results, report, and adjust.  <br><br> If your agency can't show real progress within 30 days, find a new one.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | 18        | 2        | 1 420       | 898    | 1 %      |
| **Oct 23 2025** | Thu | 12:00 PM | To the CEOs and founders reading this                                                              | *To the CEOs and founders reading this*  <br><br> You probably started your company because you're smart and driven. But please stop telling your marketers, designers and growth team exactly what to do.  <br><br> Hire people who are better than you at what they do. Then get out of their way. If you don't trust your team, you hired the wrong people – or you're the bottleneck.  <br><br> Great leaders set direction. Great teams figure out how to get there. Trust them, let them lead, and you'll see better results.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | 27        | 0        | 2 219       | 1 522  | 1 %      |
| **Oct 21 2025** | Tue | 9:00 AM  | Most fashion brands obsess over acquisition                                                        | *Most fashion brands obsess over acquisition*  <br><br> Everyone loves getting new customers. It feels like growth. But acquisition is expensive, and churn destroys profits.  <br><br> The overlooked lever? Retention. Build a loyalty program. Reward repeat customers. Create VIP tiers and make people feel valued.  <br><br> One brand we work with increased its repeat‑purchase rate by 47 % by focusing on loyalty and retention instead of blowing money on ads. Acquiring new shoppers matters, but keeping existing ones is where the profit is.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | 16        | 2        | 690         | 430    | 3 %      |
| **Oct 16 2025** | Thu | 11:00 AM | Quick copywriting tip I learned reviewing thousands of product descriptions at PacSun              | *Quick copywriting tip I learned reviewing thousands of product descriptions at PacSun*  <br><br> Read your copy out loud, as fast as you can.  <br><br> If you stumble, need to take a breath, or get tripped up by long sentences or fancy adjectives, your customers will too. They're scanning, not studying.  <br><br> Rewrite it:  <br> - Use short sentences.  <br> - Cut filler and passive language.  <br> - Stick with simple words.  <br><br> Clear, concise copy helps shoppers absorb information quickly, builds trust and increases conversions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | 19        | 4        | 1 370       | 876    | 2 %      |

People love free.  <br> 2. People love new.  <br><br> That's it. Give them free shipping, free returns, free gifts. Drop new collections often. Let your VIPs get first access. Launch limited‑edition products.  <br><br> One client boosted email revenue by 82 % just by giving their top customers early access to new drops. You don't need gimmicks – just give people what they've loved all along.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | 23        | 9        | 3 371       | 2 363  | 1 %      |
| **Oct 12 2025** | Sun | 7:45 PM  | Brand owner last week: Can you make our site look more premium?                                    | *Brand owner last week: "Can you make our site look more premium?"*  <br><br> Wrong question. A pretty site doesn't automatically make more money. A premium look without a clear value proposition, fast load times and simple checkout is just vanity.  <br><br> Instead, focus on:  <br> - Crisp product photos and clear benefit‑driven copy.  <br> - Trust badges, reviews and social proof.  <br> - A frictionless, mobile‑first checkout.  <br> - Lightning‑fast site speed.  <br><br> Nail the basics first.

They want all the bells and whistles of their old platform but assume it's just a template swap.  <br><br> Reality check:  <br> - A proper Shopify migration (with custom integrations and design) takes 3–6 months.  <br> - You need time for discovery, design, build, QA and data migration.  <br> - Rushing leads to broken sites and missed sales.  <br><br> If you want a smooth migration, plan early, set a realistic budget and timeline, and don't wait until the last minute.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | 185       | 31       | 31 477      | 20 988 | 1 %      |

Every extra second of load time sends more shoppers back to Google.  <br><br> We recently shaved 2.6 seconds off a client's load time. Their bounce rate dropped by 8 %. Conversion rate improved. Revenue spiked.  <br><br> Action items:  <br> - Optimize images and compress files.  <br> - Use a CDN.  <br> - Reduce unnecessary scripts and apps.  <br> - Test on mobile.  <br><br> Stop tolerating slow speeds.

| **Aug 17 2025** | Sun | 10:30 AM | "Traffic is up 40% this month!" Meanwhile, revenue is down 15%                                     | *"Traffic is up 40% this month!" Meanwhile, revenue is down 15 %.*  <br><br> Here's what most agencies miss: traffic and conversion are married. You can't fix one without the other.  <br><br> Bad traffic to a great site = expensive visitors who don't buy. Great traffic to a bad site = missed revenue on every click.  <br><br> Most agencies celebrate traffic wins while ignoring that your site converts at 1.2 %.  <br><br> We look at the full picture:  <br> - Traffic quality *and* site conversion rate  <br> - User‑behaviour flow (where do people drop off?)  <br> - Mobile vs. desktop experience gaps  <br> - Page‑load speed's impact on bounce rate  <br> - Checkout abandonment vs. traffic source  <br><br> Real example: we had a client getting "premium" traffic from a top agency. Conversion rate? 0.8 %.  <br><br> We fixed their mobile UX, simplified checkout and added trust signals. Same traffic, 3.1 % conversion rate. Revenue jumped 285 % without spending another dollar on ads.  <br><br> Your website is where traffic becomes money. If your agency only talks about traffic without obsessing over how that traffic converts, you're getting half a strategy. | 20        | 3        | 1 030       | 614    | 2 %      |
| **Aug 17 2025** | Sun | 11:19 AM | After running $100M+ in ecommerce revenue at PacSun, here's what I learned                         | *After running $100M+ in ecommerce revenue at PacSun, here's what I learned:*  <br><br> People don't buy better checkouts or slick animations.  <br><br> They buy outcomes that hit their core desires, like:  <br> - Looking good for a high school reunion (desirability)  <br> - Feeling confident at work (accomplishment)  <br> - Keeping up with their successful friends (social status)  <br> - Finally having something that lasts (security)  <br><br> Your Shopify store or ads might be technically perfect. But if they don't connect to real human desires, you're just another tab they'll close.  <br><br> Focus on the human first.
